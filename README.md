performing calculations, and  gain insights into the sales performance. This exploration is done by both **Tableau and PowerBI**.Based on the analysis,

customer retention initiatives, or process improvements. This project is based on the following questions:

- Create an insight to be presented to the stakeholders. Share my actions on the basis of insights.
